# Time Aware Color Smoothing

A time-aware color smoothing for pixel-based visualizations such as SpatialRugs or MotionRugs (https://github.com/jbuchmueller/motionrugs).

## Usage

base-example.ipynb  
 - Basic usage of the time-aware color smoothing with a Gaussian blur comparison
 - Display of the results of the two algorithms on spatial rug sample image

base-experiments-tacs-vs-gaussian.ipynb  
 - Same as the basic example with more parameter variations

base-experiments-colormaps.ipynb  
 - Same as the basic example with different color maps on spatial rugs
